> Project #3 of [The Modern JavaScript Masterclass](https://github.com/codingcourses/modern-javascript-masterclass).

<img src="capture.gif" />

In this project, we will be building out a web application to track one's income and expenses. We
will continue to explore [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/)'s UI components to build out a
minimalistic and aesthetically pleasing UI experience. We will briefly touch on animations in CSS
when making the total amount to change from green (positive $) to grey ($0) to red (negative $).

## Learning Goals

These are specific topics covered in this project:

- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) components: grid, text input, button, notifications
- CSS animations
- Client side validation with regular expressions
