> Project #3 of [The Modern JavaScript Masterclass](https://github.com/codingcourses/modern-javascript-masterclass).

<img src="capture.gif" />

In this project, we will be building out a web application to track one's income and expenses. We
will learn about how to use third-party front-end libraries like [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) to
rapidly build out nice user interfaces, client-side validation with regular expressions, and
continue to practice with the MVC design pattern.

## Learning Goals

These are specific topics covered in this project:

- [UIkit](https://getuikit.com/) components: grid, text input, button, notifications
- Client side validation with regular expressions
